# How It's Made:
Tech used: HTML, CSS, JavaScript

I was studying HTML, CSS, and JavaScript with my 2022 cohort of #100Devs. I already was feeling comfortable with basic JS and wanted to build something that would help my fellow classmates practice the skills we were learning. As a teacher, the first thing that came to mind was a quiz. I love helping others learn and knew that by building this project I would not only be helping others, but also helping myself! Everybody wins!

# Optimizations: 
I didn't get to refactor a lot of this code, but I did try to focus on making the code readable and easy to digest. Most of the lines of code are actually the question that I wrote. 

# Lessons Learned:
Creating html elements on clicks was an eye opener. For some other projects I had them all set up and didn't create them, instead I used CSS to hide and unhide them. For this, it runs faster and is cleaner. 
I also learned a few things about JS and had to dig into correct syntax/error analysis.
